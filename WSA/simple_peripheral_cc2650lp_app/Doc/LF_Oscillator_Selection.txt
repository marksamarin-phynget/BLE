Notes for LF Oscillator Selection

The internal LF oscillator may be used in place of the external 32Khz crystail with some software additions.
The procedure requires constant recalibratoinof the internal oscillator since it is sensitive to temperature changes.
The BLE stack will do the heavy lifting for this when set up correctly.

Note that this should pnly be used of silicon revisions 'D' and greater as the internal clock has a glitch bug in earlier ones.

(Detailed instructions for this procedure are in TI doc swra499b)


Internal LF oscillator selection:

1) Include ccfg_app_bl_rcosc.c in build
2) Exclude cfg_app_ble.c from build
3) Use USE_RCOSC compiler predefine 
4) Set SET_CCFG_MODE_CONF_SCLK_LF_OPTION to '3' in cfg_app_ble_rcosc.c
 
External LF oscillator selection:

1) Exclude ccfg_app_bl_rcosc.c from build
2) Include cfg_app_ble.c in build
3) Remove USE_RCOSC compiler predefine 
* Not necessary - 4) Set SET_CCFG_MODE_CONF_SCLK_LF_OPTION to '2' in cfg_app_ble_rcosc.c
