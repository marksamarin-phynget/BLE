PWD BLE board Software Development Setup


1)  Clone BLE repository to selected directory (<BLE_Home>)

    The repository is publicly available currently located at:
        
        https://github.com/marksamarin-phynget/BLE.git

	
    
2) Install Code Composer V7.4 to C:\ti\CCS740

	Browse to: http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/Download_CCS#Code_Composer_Studio_Version_7_Downloads
	
    * For Processor support, select: SimpleLink CC13xx and CC26xx Wireless MCUs
	
    * For Debug support, select TI XDS and Spectrum Digital Probes
	
	When starting CCS, select <BLE_Home>/WSA as you workspace directory.
    
    

3)  SETUP CCS TOOLS (RTOS, XDCTOOLS)

	In CCS, go to Window->Preferences-Code Composer Studio->Products    
	and uninstall any packages automatically added by the CCS install (such XDCTOOLS packages)

	(You do not need to restart CCS yet)
	
	Add <BLE_Home>\BLE\ti to the to discovery path and press the Rediscover button.
	
	select the following tools for install:
	
        <BLE_Home>\BLE\ti\tirtos_cc13xx_cc26xx_2_20_01_08
        <BLE_Home>\BLE\ti\\xdctools_3_32_00_06_core
  
    For convenience, uncheck the "search for new installable products..." box.
	
    Important:  Do not use the original RTOS and BLE stack any libraries downloaded from TI as there have been modifications.
                The original downloads are available from ti.com if needed for comparison purposes.
   

   
4) Import the BLE application (and stack project if desired) into your workspace:
 
	Project->Import CCS Projects->Select Search Directory, browse to:
		
        <BLE_Home>/BLE/WSA
   
    and select:
    
        simple_peripheral_cc2650lp_app 
        simple_peripheral_cc2650lp_stack (if desired)
        
        
5)  If done correctly, the simple_peripheral_cc2650lp_app should build completely now.  
    
    Verify this by locating the executable hex file time stamp at: 
	
		C:\BLE\WSA\simple_peripheral_cc2650lp_app\FlashROM \simple_peripheral_cc2650lp_app.hex  
   
   
    If the project fails to build, pay close attention to 
    
        - the paths and Linked Resources under Project->Properties 
        - the compiler include paths
        - the package paths as described in 3)
