</span>    17    <span class="xdoc"> *  Utility that creates a closed bundle
</span>    18    <span class="xdoc"> *
</span>    19    <span class="xdoc"> *  The purpose of this tool is to build a bundle containing all packages
</span>    20    <span class="xdoc"> *  loaded in the process of configuring an application. The bundle is
</span>    21    <span class="xdoc"> *  built in a user-selected repository, which can be then relocated to
</span>    22    <span class="xdoc"> *  a different location or to a different host, where the application
</span>    23    <span class="xdoc"> *  being configured can be recompiled and relinked.
</span>    24    <span class="xdoc"> *
</span>    25    <span class="xdoc"> *  The closure tool can run only after {<b>@link</b> xdc.tools.configuro} runs
</span>    26    <span class="xdoc"> *  and finishes the configuration step. Then, `xdc.tools.closure' detects
</span>    27    <span class="xdoc"> *  all packages involved in the configuration and copies them to a new
</span>    28    <span class="xdoc"> *  repository. All absolute paths in the relevant generated files that
</span>    29    <span class="xdoc"> *  could be accessed by the user's makefile, when the application is
</span>    30    <span class="xdoc"> *  rebuilt, are transformed into the paths relative to the the directory
</span>    31    <span class="xdoc"> *  containing the closed bundle.
</span>    32    <span class="xdoc"> *
</span>    33    <span class="xdoc"> *  Some files in the copied packages are deleted to keep the size of
</span>    34    <span class="xdoc"> *  the closed bundle manageable. The default filtering setting causes only
</span>    35    <span class="xdoc"> *  selected files to be deleted, for example C sources or object files that
</span>    36    <span class="xdoc"> *  are copied into a library. A user has an option of requesting other
</span>    37    <span class="xdoc"> *  evels of filtering from not filtering anything to the most aggressive
</span>    38    <span class="xdoc"> *  filtering of files, which leaves in the closed bundle only header files
</span>    39    <span class="xdoc"> *  and libraries referenced by linker command files. Here are the filtering
</span>    40    <span class="xdoc"> *  levels:

</span>    42    <span class="xdoc"> *  - 0   - all files are preserved

</span>    44    <span class="xdoc"> *          PDF files and internal RTSC files are deleted
</span>    45    <span class="xdoc"> *  - 2   - left for future expansion, currently same as 1

</span>    47    <span class="xdoc"> *          are also deleted
</span>    48    <span class="xdoc"> *  - 4   - same as 3
